说话人1 00:00
And styles.
说话人2 00:05
This is a commonly played in a museum and this up cars. Maybe they are when you visit the museum and it's a through news. This is a called cube museum.

It's have only one cube, but it has a multiple card like

Like this, each artifact, a has a card. And you can you can, you can use this card to in replace this.

You also can use this the application to explain the AR I II I want to know which I II want you older this three interaction techniques, according your personal interests.
说话人1 01:17
123.
说话人2 01:19
So maybe you can simply explain why you charge have this choice.
说话人1 01:28
This one is this Information. So it's that's very confusing. If I want to see Information, then using the application, I can see it. And let's say some of them. I don't want to say anything. I just want to see how they look. So it's very goods. It's very easy to say. But this one has a little bit more Information, so it can be a bit confusing. Since this is also better than this one, because I can see the real object here and then i can see these, different angles. This one, there's so many Information that I don't want to read and say objects. I can ask you an application, so I cannot feel how the object really looks like.
说话人2 02:18
I want to uh ask you if you should choose one introduction style to help you.
说话人1 02:29
For learn.
说话人2 02:30
You will choose which one just for learning.
说话人1 02:35
That's for learning. I'm gonna go with this one.
说话人2 02:41
Also, I want to see, hear you.
说话人1 02:45
Your . uh okay.
说话人2 02:46
Opinions.
说话人1 02:47
Why? This one? First, if I just want to learn and all the Information that you see, it's already including here and Information that it also includes the object itself. So I can see the object and I can see the Information. This one is also, okay, but at first glance, you are not motivated to see the Information behind. Got it.
说话人2 03:19
Next question, I want to ask you which style you think that you have a more deeply impressed?

Uh of, these artifacts,
说话人1 03:35
Deeply affect.
说话人2 03:37
I.
说话人1 03:40
Images, which one give is the deepest impression. This one, this one.

II feel like this too, will kind of the same but uh. Yeah, they're kind of same. I I could suppose objects in treaty model and I can and then in different angles. It was a let's say, this.

Because you can.
说话人2 04:09
Hold it in your hand.
说话人1 04:13
I maybe because of that, because I can hold it and then rotate it myself different, but this one, maybe a little bit harder. Could be that one instinct telling me to go to school.
说话人2 04:27
And we also provide to rotate styles in the cube and the postcard. So which interest you prefer to rotate by the physical object or just use the finger structures on screens, which.
说话人1 04:46
I prefer the physical like this one catching. It's easy to rotate it. Got it.
说话人2 04:54
The next question I want to ask you, if you are going to buy a souvenir in the museum, you have this choice, you can buy it is for yourself, or you also can buy them for for your friend. So you have, so which one you will choose?
说话人1 05:19
I just cool. For yourself or, for some both for myself and my friends.
说话人2 05:27
Why you will choose this one?
说话人1 05:32
First, maybe it's very protected.

And this one, this one could be like it has small, and it has four different Information, right? Four different conflicts in one place, but this one is like different, right? So I probably go with this one.
说话人2 05:57
Go there. I suppose if you have already have this QQ museum, and now you will go to another music and you will see and and. You can see a lot of card like this also are on this job. You will continue to buy this card for your.
说话人3 06:20
Or qq.
说话人1 06:23
Um like. There's no other cook on in this class, right?
说话人2 06:28
You have the queue, but yeah.
说话人1 06:31
And the Information, right?

If I find those cards like let's say, an object interesting, like this one camel is I think it's interesting. If I see this one in here, then i'll back.
说话人2 06:44
What about the postcard? Maybe your friend give you some postcard to you, and you may be able to go to another museum. I see the similar postcard like this one. You will continue to collect them.
说话人1 07:08
Um no.
说话人2 07:09
No. Hi, hi.
说话人1 07:13
The postcards doesn't look very appealing because of many Information located in the same page.
说话人4 07:23
Yeah. Got it.
说话人1 07:25
It's there. And.
说话人4 07:28
Like.
说话人1 07:29
For me, looking at the objects I in the first thing is not looking the Information behind it. It's.
说话人2 07:35
How.
说话人1 07:36
They cool, they look. So this one is like very few Information. So just the object itself. So this is what I'm more appeal to. If it has more Information than it doesn't look at.
说话人2 07:50
Feeling that much.
说话人4 07:52
Go ahead.
说话人1 07:53
I the good thing is, if I can look in Information behind this and just with application and then say it, right? So I I think this one is good. I can make a collection of this one, but not this one.
说话人4 08:06
Go ahead. How do you feel like?
说话人3 08:10
Performance on the learning. Question is.
说话人1 08:15
It was compared to this. I think this one was better.
说话人2 08:23
Do you think your performance on the expected.
说话人1 08:25
That was a cute. Actually postcard was better, okay? Because there was some these dinners is right in English, but there was not in English yet, so it was Chinese.
说话人2 08:34
Alright.
说话人3 08:36
You barely check the Information when you're using the queue.
说话人4 08:40
Yeah, why not?
说话人1 08:41
You are for myself, you wanna go to museum. I'm more interested in the objects. It's like it's how they look and not. What is the Information behind it? Right?

Even this one's, I didn't read the Information. I just did the basic Information here.
说话人4 08:58
Okay, that's it.
说话人3 08:59
Don't you just in the story behind?
说话人2 09:04
No. Not. Really. Yeah.
说话人3 09:10
Do you have any questions for us?
说话人1 09:13
How long does it take this project to finish this project?
说话人3 09:17
This is part of my self project, so they did it basically this summer.
说话人1 09:23
That's very cold.
说话人3 09:25
It's actually less than so much. The development was not that hard. It's about like 2 weeks or two yet to learn to the development.
说话人1 09:33
And how many person? In my group?

12.
说话人3 09:36
To person. But for the question is it takes more efforts to prepare. You got more person involved in the project.
说话人4 09:44
Okay.
说话人1 09:46
The objects you made it by yourself from this.
说话人2 09:50
The object.
说话人3 09:51
Call taken from Chinese museums, basically. And we use all the barbecue to build Israeli models and then do some editing and touching the writings in the same.
说话人1 10:02
Yeah, I notice it was pretty detail.
