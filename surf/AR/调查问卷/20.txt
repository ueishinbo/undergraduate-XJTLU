These things will go compared to this one leave that it would be earlier annoying to handle, because most of the times when you go to museums, lift letters are meant to be big, right? For example, if I want to see only this single stuff, it's a little bit like confusing because you have all of these things. And in terms of like, if you are gonna use the AR it's gonna have the issue of not detecting both. It's gonna have the issue of one appears on 1,000, right? So it's much better to have like a single different.
说话人2 00:30
So you say.
说话人3 00:31
You think you want to keep this Information on paper rather than you know.
说话人2 00:39
See this on.
说话人3 00:40
On the screen.
说话人1 00:41
No, I like you in terms of this tree, right? So this will be better than.
说话人3 00:46
Among all of this and and and and use. And I notice you mentioned the.
说话人2 00:51
It is.
说话人3 00:52
To light.
说话人1 00:54
Yeah, it's like this.
说话人3 00:55
You think this?
说话人2 00:56
Season so.
说话人1 00:58
I feel like it's not more about whether this is lighter or not. It's more like because most of the cubes, right? That it's literally this piece, right? What's important is what is in this paper, right? So it wouldn't make a big difference. I if I have this or it doesn't really make a big difference. If I want to make a letter, a cube, I could just how this is like a cube and.
说话人3 01:20
Literally be a queue.
说话人1 01:21
Hey, so it's not big of a difference. So in terms of like which one is more portable, if you're going to into a museum which is more like better to give to someone. Do you think this giving this to one person? This one, this one, right? So.
说话人3 01:34
I think you are.
说话人2 01:35
All of. These questions?
说话人4 01:36
Uh uh.
说话人2 01:37
Spilled on us.
说话人3 01:38
Suppose you are in the museum and maybe.
说话人2 01:41
I want to ask.
说话人3 01:42
Us through your experience.
说话人2 01:44
Experience.
说话人3 01:46
D three, which you prefer best up for.
说话人2 01:53
Don't uh uh.
说话人3 01:55
You don't need to.
说话人2 01:56
Uh it is have this.
说话人3 01:59
Suppose you are in the museum.
说话人2 02:01
Just think about.
说话人3 02:06
To your.
说话人2 02:07
Experience.
说话人3 02:12
You you the through your experience on using this. 3.
说话人1 02:19
May I go first for this, for a queue and second for a lift left? And a postcard, and then second for the last for a little bit.
说话人2 02:27
I'm got it.
说话人3 02:28
So I also want to see your reasons for this choice.
说话人1 02:34
Let's say, for example, the first one is to leave the queue. You have everything in just one. You can see everything that you need to see in just 1 piece, whether as postcard, it's in different postcard. So it's a lot less convenient college. It's more about which one is more convenient, convenient. And also, if we compare different is also in terms of this to both convenient, right? But this one will be more appealing to people, because this is a little bit like updated in terms of like, yeah.
说话人3 03:10
So people will be more.
说话人1 03:11
Catch for this. I will go for this one. First one.
说话人3 03:15
So.
说话人2 03:16
So for for learning.
说话人3 03:18
Which one you prefer best, because you think is.
说话人2 03:22
I have the best.
说话人3 03:24
Effect for your learning.
说话人1 03:27
It's hard to say, but I will it's hard to say because they there are kind of different, but also don't have like that big of a difference, right?
说话人3 03:41
Yeah. So.
说话人1 03:42
So maybe for me, personally, I would pay postcards, postcard because postcards I can also use them in other ways that I can always place them in any place. For example, if I'm reading a book, I can use it like to put in a book, right? Any time every time I see, right? Yeah, leave that you probably just leave it on, never take it, right? So it's not like the best. Thank you. It just not convenient.
说话人3 04:08
Take it, everywhere so.
说话人1 04:09
I will go for postcard.
说话人2 04:12
And.
说话人3 04:14
We provide to rotate to charity styles.
说话人2 04:19
On the post.
说话人3 04:20
Skirt and cool.
说话人2 04:21
So do.
说话人3 04:23
Which style your.
说话人2 04:25
For it's one.
说话人3 04:27
Is you just.
说话人2 04:28
Rotated by the physical.
说话人3 04:30
Object, all your.
说话人2 04:31
Use the.
说话人3 04:32
Structures and rotate on the screen. So which one you style you prefer?
说话人1 04:37
I prefer physically, yeah. Because in the phone sometimes it lacks for some phones in my lap. Because like some phones are cheaper than the other, so they might not switch that like so I prefer physical and also you have the feedback, right? You can just see it. But when you use the phone, there's no feedback.
说话人3 04:59
Go ahead.
说话人2 05:02
For.
说话人3 05:03
Next, I want to.
说话人2 05:04
II wonder.
说话人3 05:05
Which style? Let you have.
说话人2 05:10
Got the deep in.
说话人3 05:13
Impress.
说话人2 05:15
About the.
说话人3 05:16
Three d graphics.
说话人1 05:18
The QQ why? Are you mean the graphics, these graphics, or.
说话人3 05:26
Three graph, graphics.
说话人1 05:28
Wearing that kind of like the same.
说话人3 05:30
Not for the artifacts in themselves, but through the I want you just choose these three amongst these into three introduction styles. I switch instruction styles that you go have the more in press on the three d graphics. The artificial the heritage graph is three d graphics.
说话人1 06:05
May I always take the first one? Postcard maybe, because II don't think I'm understanding the question completely. So.
说话人3 06:14
I'm so sorry that.
说话人1 06:16
Anything about it?
说话人3 06:19
You can see the three d the graphics of this object through these three interaction styles. And I wonder which styles. Let you have the uh most deep impress on postcard.
说话人1 06:47
Your because we posted, I can only see one. If i've no matter how I flip, I can only see one, but q sometimes let's say you look at this. It has direct so. You will have the issue of like, it does not detect the one that you actually want to see. I was a postcard understand.
说话人3 07:08
And now let's have a sport. If you going to a museum and you, you want to buy a souvenir for yourself or you buy for your friends. So which one you will take?
说话人1 07:27
By the queue. The first. Yeah, it's Free. Well.
说话人3 07:33
For yourself or your friend, I will have the same choice.
说话人1 07:37
Got it.
说话人3 07:40
You have some personal reasons.
说话人1 07:45
Because like, since it's a souvenir, right, then i'll pick the cube because it's more like a souvenir. And people can actually look at it and use the application itself and see every material right yeah and see all the artifacts that are in the museum right in, just 1 piece as postcard, you can not do that. Because it comes with many different ones, right? And they might lose one or two, so they cannot have the whole experience of the missing.
说话人3 08:14
It's easy for collection.
说话人1 08:15
Mhm yeah.
说话人3 08:17
Another sport if you have by a queue for yourself.
说话人1 08:23
And maybe.
说话人3 08:25
Your friend give you a lot of this post AR postcard. Mhm. So you already have these tools and you will go to another museum and see there are some similar postcard and about another other assets. Will you keep going? Will you continue to buy this and collect this post card?
说话人1 08:54
Personally, I won't because I'm not a person who likes to collect a lot of stuff. But I know people who are willing to do it.
说话人3 09:02
Got it. For what about cube? You maybe you will see some artificial card on other museum, and you also can replace this card on your cue.
说话人1 09:15
Same reason like I will not collect more, I just keep it like that. Got it. But there are people who are willing to like, I know I agree like, I have a group of friends and probably five of us. I will be the only one that like for that.
说话人3 09:31
Do you have some questions for ask us?
说话人1 09:34
I don't, think so. How long did you take for you guys to build the air? A mouse.
说话人3 09:45
In less amount.
说话人1 09:46
Yeah, less than one more and with. How many people?
说话人3 09:50
We to develop the application for the whole experience and whole paper, we will have three or and our friend are also will assist assist on us.
说话人1 10:06
